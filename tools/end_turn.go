Before calling end_turn, ask yourself:
- Did I just do a write/edit? Add a build or grep to verify it.
- Did I just read one file? Are there other files I need for the same understanding?
- Could I batch another quick operation into this turn?

Each API round-trip costs tokens. Maximize what you accomplish before ending the turn.`,
